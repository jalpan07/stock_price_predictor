# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Overview
This project involves predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The program takes user input for the stock symbol, the starting year for data analysis, and the number of days of data to be used. It then fetches historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance, scales the data, and trains an LSTM model to make predictions. The predictions are then compared with the actual stock prices and visualized for analysis.

## Prerequisites 
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the stock symbol when prompted.
3. Enter the starting year for data analysis.
4. Specify the number of days of data to be used.
5. The program fetches the data, trains the model, and visualizes the results.

## File Structure
- `stock_prediction.py`: Main script for stock price prediction.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Run
```bash
python stock_prediction.py
```

## Note
This code is a basic implementation for educational purposes. It may require further optimization for practical applications and accurate predictions. Additionally, consider using more advanced techniques and incorporating additional features for a more robust model.
